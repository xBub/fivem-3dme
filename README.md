A chat command for FiveM made by xBub_ Development. xBub_#0001 on Discord: https://discord.gg/Y3X2FgjSXv

This is a free release because I never see enough of these for free or at all.

A FiveM script written in LUA that implements the /me command that appears in chat (proximity) with 3D printing.

The /me command allows you to display a specific action above the head of a player. It's particularly used for actions that couldn't have been done in game in a roleplay context.
