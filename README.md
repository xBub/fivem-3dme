A chat command for FiveM made by xBub_ Development. xBub_#0001 on Discord: https://discord.gg/Y3X2FgjSXv

A FiveM script written in LUA that implements the /me command with 3D printing.

The /me command allows you to display a specific action above the head of a player. It's particularly used for actions that couldn't have been done in game in a roleplay context.
